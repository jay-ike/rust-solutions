# Solutions for Rust Challenges
This project is initally inspired by [ken youens-clark](mailto:kyclark@gmail.com)'s book [Command-Line Rust](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/command-line-rust/9781098109424) (O'Reilly 2022/2024 ISBN: 97811098109417)

## Synopsis
The book provided me a set of Challenges to implement partially or completely (based on the complexity of the program) a UNIX command in rust in each chapter the best way I found to read the book was by solving the problems with code.
The book's approach is to solve these Challenges while emphasizing the test driven development (TDD) discipline.

The Commands I had to implement are:

- cal
- cat
- comm
- cut
- echo
- find
- forturne
- grep
- head
- ls
- tail
- tree
- uniq
- wc
